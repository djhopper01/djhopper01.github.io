title: An Open Fort Wayne

I'm beginning to work toward a vision I have for the city of Fort Wayne. I want to bring the right people and all of the data sources for the city to one place. [Other cities are doing it](http://www.opendataphilly.org/), and Fort Wayne can do it, too.

The idea is simple and is used by companies across the world. Let's use Apple as an example. They couldn't possibly think of all the amazing apps that are out there today. Instead, they gave developers tools to work with and created the App Store. They used the engineering population to build their ecosystem.

Now, some cities are doing this on a smaller scale. They're making many different data sources available in standard formats. They're doing this in ways that connect with modern developers. This is what these cities are saying, "Here's a ton of data we've collected over the years. It's in a format you like. Take it and run with it."

This is what I hope we can do in Fort Wayne. There are data sources out there. I want to get them in one place.

Imagine one day, we can provide these data sources to students at IPFW, Indiana Tech, and others. They'll come up with all kinds of crazy and interesting apps we haven't thought about yet. They'll be able to correlate these data sources and compare them.

If you're interesting in learning more, take a look at [CityOfFortWayne/ideas on GitHub](https://github.com/CityOfFortWayne/ideas). I'm doing all of this in the open so anyone can participate. All you need is a GitHub account.
