Hey there, I'm Derek.

I'm the lead engineer at [Tula Software](https://tulasoftware.com). We also help people build stuff at [Ideal](http://idealprojectgroup.com). I blog in a couple places ([Project Idealism](http://projectidealism.com) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@derekjhopper)) and tweet in one ([@derekjhopper](https://twitter.com/derekjhopper)).

Here are some of my favorites:

- [The right way to think about TDD](http://projectidealism.com/posts/2014/1/28/the-right-way-to-think-about-tdd)
- [Milestones and how Code Climate helped us reach them](http://projectidealism.com/posts/2013/11/14/milestones)
- [Open Sourced: I’m an employee with Crohn’s](https://medium.com/@derekjhopper/open-sourced-im-an-employee-with-crohns-9bb4e27ad0db)

I don't really know what I'm going to do with this space, but I'll think of something. If you have any good ideas, feel free to send me a tweet.
