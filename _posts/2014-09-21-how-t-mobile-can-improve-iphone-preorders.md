title: How T-Mobile can improve iPhone preorders and why customer service should be your differentiator

I preordered an iPhone 6 from T-Mobile on September 12th. T-Mobile defintely screwed up in a number of areas, but they also excelled in a few. For example, they upgraded every preorder to next day air and even paid for Saturday deliveries when available. Some companies wouldn't think to do this, so I have to give credit to T-Mobile here.

This is a constructive article on how they can improve and get even better.

## Tighter integration of customer service with your supply chain.

In the long run, this may be an engineering problem. You may have to build systems so that customer service has insight into actual data about inventory. Instead of using canned lines here, customer service could theoretically communicate with actual data.

However, this can be handled manually without any automation. Using the right messaging would likely solve a lot of this. People preordering iPhones usually have an idea of when Apple starts to ship them to the United States. They know you don't have inventory, so there's no need to use the term "backorder". At first, you could simply say Apple hasn't yet shipped any devices. Once Apple starts shipping devices and people inquire about the status, you could direct people to an [article about why progress is slow](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/17/foxconn-iphone-6-shortage/).

Automation is the next step. Customer service should know the exact moment inventory begins to arrive. It looks really bad when people get tracking numbers through UPS and customer service is still saying things are on "backorder". If the integration was there, customer service could think on their feet and say the items have begun shipping out.

## Use different order statuses.

- Pending
- Payment processed
- Not yet ready for shipment
- Preparing for shipment
- Shipping soon
- Shipped
- Delivered

I can't find the exact list of order statuses for Amazon, but if my memory serves me, I think it's something like the above. For the most part, these statuses are clear. You know exactly what's going on at each stage. I've never seen Amazon use the term backorder, but if they do, I'd love to find out why.

Each of the order statuses seem to give the customer some hope that something is happening. I've never seen an order jump from Pending to Shipped. Instead, there's a nice cadence as your order progresses through each of the statuses. You're never left in the dark.

## Ensure your systems are always in sync with accurate data.

T-Mobile may have a strong engineering team in the field for their cellular technologies, but their web and fulfillment technology seems lacking. It may be a function of budget. Give the web and fulfillment teams a bigger engineering budget and they may be able to fix things up.

Things like order status and updates on inventory should be communicated instantly between teams that need to know. Customer service shouldn't be saying things are on backorder for six weeks when you've just received more inventory to ship out. You shouldn't have a website littered with 500 errors. There's money to be made here with just a bunch of small improvements to the website.

If a customer wants to check their order status on the web, they should be able to do it. You shouldn't get a 500 error, and if it does, it should return a meaningful error message instead of a generic one.

## Don't queue up order notifications unless they're backed by up-to-date information.

Some order notifications seemed like they were queued up on September 12 when people first ordered. This isn't a very good idea. A lot can change over a few days. If you queue up a message telling someone they'll be receiving their item on a certain day, you're already setting yourself up for failure. It's a notification that isn't backed by any evidence and that's a problem.

These notifications should instead be triggered by key events in your systems. If a customer's item is being boxed up, send a notification immediately. When the shipping label is created, send a notification immediately.

Once you break the trust of your customer with an inaccurate notification, it's hard to get it back. It ends up drastically increasing the cost since these customers are hounding your customer service agents.

## More communication isn't always better. Instead, focus on accuracy.

Don't send out a message saying you'll send an update in one to two days, then send an update in three or four days. It just doesn't make sense. If your order statuses are good, you shouldn't need to send that text message at all.

By sending inaccurate updates, you compound the problem. With T-Mobile, [UPS My Choice](http://www.ups.com/mychoice/) started to be a more accurate method of checking your order status. That's not good. For example, most customers would receive accurate notifications from UPS, then finally receive notifications from T-Mobile sometimes more than eight hours later.

## Bonus Credit: Handle the massive amounts of traffic.

This is a tough one, but is solved by companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. If you make engineering on the web team a priority, you'll be able to solve it. It would be a huge differentiator to say your site didn't go down, but Apple and the rest were dead in the water. Simply invest in great engineering talent and give them a proper budget, and you'll be able to handle the capacity.
